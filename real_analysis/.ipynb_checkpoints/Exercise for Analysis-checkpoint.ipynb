    "X and Y is true or X or Y is false.\n",

    "(X is true and Y is false) or (X is false and Y is true)\n",
    "### Exercise A.1.3. Suppose that you have shown that whenever X is true, then Y is true, and whenever X is false, then Y is false. Have you now demonstrated that X and Y are logically equivalent? Explain.\n",
    "We have demonstrated that X and Y are logically equivalent.\n",
    "<br>The negation of statement \"whenever X is false, then Y is false\" is \"whenever Y is true, then X is true.\" Those are the condition demostrate the two are equivalent.\n",
    "<br><font color=red>If statement \"whenever Y is true, then X is true\" is false, then when Y is true, X is false, then Y is false. It is controdictory with \"Y is true\".\n",
    "<br>So whenever Y is true, then X is true.\n",
    "<br>Then, X and Y are logically equivalent.</font>\n",
    "### Exercise A.1.4. Suppose that you have shown that whenever X is true, then Y is true, and whenever Y is false, then X is false. Have you now demonstrated that X is true if and only if Y is true? Explain.\n",
    "The later statement is equivalent to the former, so we can't demonstrate \"X is true iff Y is true.\"\n",
    "### Exercise A.1.5. Suppose you know that X is true if and only if Y is true, and you know that Y is true if and only if Z is true. Is this enough to show that X, Y,Z are all logically equivalent? Explain.\n",
    "we know that $ X \\Leftrightarrow Y $, and $ Y \\Leftrightarrow Z $.\n",
    "<br>Then whenever if X is true, then Y is true, and the Z if true;\n",
    "similarly, whenever if Z is true, the Y is true, and then X is true.\n",
    "<br>In short, whenever if X is true, then Z is true, and whenever Z is true, X is true, meaning $ X \\Leftrightarrow Z $.\n",
    "### Exercise A.1.6. Suppose you know that whenever X is true, then Y is true; that whenever Y is true, then Z is true; and whenever Z is true, then X is true. Is this enough to show that X, Y,Z are all logically equivalent? Explain.\n",
    "That mean whenever X is true, then Z is true, and whenever Z is true, then X is true. So $ X \\Leftrightarrow Z $, meaning X is equivalent to Z.\n",
    "<br>That means whenever X is true, then Y is true; whenever Y is true, then X is true. So, $X \\Leftrightarrow Y \\Leftrightarrow Z $."
